# wacraft-server

This is the backend server for the **[wacraft project](https://github.com/Astervia/wacraft)** — a development platform for the WhatsApp Cloud API.

With **wacraft**, you can send and receive WhatsApp messages, handle webhooks, and perform a wide variety of operations using a consistent and extensible API.

For details on client usage, see:

- 🔗 [wacraft repository](https://github.com/Astervia/wacraft): full-featured platform for supporters.
- 🔗 [wacraft-lite repository](https://github.com/Astervia/wacraft): optimized for typical use cases and non-supporters.

Both repositories include full API documentation.

This `README.md` focuses on the server (this repo).

## 🧪 Getting Started

### 📦 Environment Variables

Create your `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

Fill in your WhatsApp Cloud API credentials and other required values. Descriptions for each variable are included in `.env.local`.

> ⚠️ **Don't skip variables or remove them unless you're sure.**

### 🐳 Running with Docker (Recommended)

Use the `Makefile`:

```bash
make dev  # Development mode (with live reload)
make prod # Production mode
```

- `docker-compose.dev.yml`: optimized for development, includes hot-reloading.
- `docker-compose.yml`: for production, always pulls the latest `wacraft-server`.

> ℹ️ Tip: Check the `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose` files to customize the behavior as needed.

> ℹ️ Tip: If you get any SSH errors when running the compose files, hit

    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
    or the equivalent for your SSH key.

### 🔁 Running with Live Reload

Install [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) and run:

```bash
air
```

### 🏃 Running with `go run`

```bash
go run main.go
```

### ⚙️ Running the Compiled Executable

```bash
make build
./bin/wacraft-server
```

## 📘 OpenAPI Documentation

API documentation is automatically updated when you run:

```bash
make build
```

Or manually via:

```bash
swag init --parseDependency
```

> 🛠 You’ll need [`swaggo`](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) installed.

## 🧬 Database Migrations

We use GORM for automatic schema generation and structure migrations in two stages:

### 1. **Before GORM Auto-Migrations**

```bash
goose -dir src/database/migrations-before create migration_name go   # Go-based
goose -dir src/database/migrations-before create migration_name sql  # SQL-based
```

### 2. **After GORM Auto-Migrations**

```bash
goose -dir src/database/migrations create migration_name go   # Go-based
goose -dir src/database/migrations create migration_name sql  # SQL-based
```

> 🐤 Migration tool: [`pressly/goose`](https://github.com/pressly/goose)

## 🐋 Docker Image

### 🔨 Build Instructions

To support private modules when building the Docker image, use SSH forwarding:

```bash
docker build --ssh default -t wacraft-server:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

## Meta authentication

### Verification Requests

Set the environment variable `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and configure your webhook URL in the Meta developer console with this variable as the verify token. If you don't provide this environment variable, no authentication will be applied at Meta's Verification Requests.

### Event Notifications

We authenticate event notification webhooks from Meta using the App Secret and the `X-Hub-Signature-256` header. If you set the environment variable `META_APP_SECRET`, the server will verify the signature of incoming webhooks. If the signature is invalid, the server will return a 403 Forbidden response. If you don't set the environment variable, the server will not verify the signature and will accept all incoming webhooks which is not recommended for production environments.

> ℹ️ Tip: Make sure that you are passing the correct headers if using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik or an AWS Load Balancer. The `X-Hub-Signature-256` header must be passed to the backend server.

## 🚀 Creating the Lite Version

We maintain a separate repository for the [lite version of wacraft-server](https://github.com/Astervia/wacraft-server-lite), which removes premium-only features for public or non-supporter use.

To generate and sync the `wacraft-server-lite` repository from this full version, use the `sync-lite.sh` script in the root directory.

### 🔧 How It Works

- Removes all code blocks between `// PREMIUM STARTS` and `// PREMIUM ENDS` across all files.
- Deletes specific premium-only files and folders.
- Commits the result and pushes to the [`wacraft-server-lite`](https://github.com/Astervia/wacraft-server-lite) repository.

### ▶️ How to Use

1. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./sync-lite.sh
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./sync-lite.sh
    ```

This will:

- Clone the current repository into a temporary directory,
- Strip out premium-only code and content,
- Push the cleaned version directly to the `main` branch of `wacraft-server-lite`.

> ⚠️ This script will **force-push** to the `lite` repo, replacing its contents with the current state from this repository (minus premium content). Use with care.
